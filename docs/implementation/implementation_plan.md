# Implementation Plan for Rule-Based Credit Behaviour Insight Engine

## 1. Project Setup
- **Create Project Repository**: Set up a Git repository for version control.
- **Folder Structure**: Implement the suggested folder structure as outlined in the project requirements.

## 2. Data Input Module
- **PDF Parsing**: 
  - Research and select a suitable library (e.g., `pdfparser`) for extracting data from CTOS credit report PDFs.
  - Implement a preprocessing module to convert PDF data into structured JSON tables.
- **Data Normalization**: 
  - Develop functions to clean and normalize the extracted data into a consistent format.

## 3. Rule Engine Development
- **Define Rules**: 
  - Create a JSON or YAML file to store behavioral labels, compound types, conditions, templates, and recommendations.
- **Logic Implementation**: 
  - Develop the core logic to evaluate conditions and generate insights based on the input data.

## 4. Condition Parser
- **Expression Evaluation**: 
  - Implement a condition parser using libraries like `asteval` or `expr-eval` to safely evaluate logical expressions.
- **Null Handling**: 
  - Ensure the parser can gracefully handle missing or null values.

## 5. Template Renderer
- **Dynamic Template Generation**: 
  - Create a template rendering system using `jinja2` or custom logic to replace placeholders with actual values from the input data.

## 6. Output Aggregator
- **Insight Grouping**: 
  - Develop functionality to group insights by label or section and rank them by severity or frequency.
- **Report Generation**: 
  - Implement export functionality to generate reports in JSON, HTML, or PDF formats.

## 7. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Write unit tests for each module to ensure functionality and reliability.
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Conduct integration tests to verify that all components work together as expected.

## 8. Compliance and Review
- **Compliance Check**: 
  - Review all outputs to ensure they meet compliance requirements (no financial product recommendations, neutral messaging).
- **Feedback Mechanism**: 
  - Implement a feedback logging system to capture user flags or ratings for continuous improvement.

## 9. Future Enhancements
- **Machine Learning Integration**: 
  - Explore the possibility of training ML models using labeled data for predictive insights.
- **User Interface Development**: 
  - Plan for integration with a user interface for real-time recommendations.

## 10. Documentation
- **User Documentation**: 
  - Create comprehensive user documentation detailing how to use the system.
- **Technical Documentation**: 
  - Document the codebase and architecture for future developers.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Project setup and data input module development.
- **Week 3-4**: Rule engine and condition parser implementation.
- **Week 5**: Template renderer and output aggregator development.
- **Week 6**: Testing and compliance review.
- **Week 7**: Future enhancements planning and documentation.

# Rule Engine Module for Rule-Based Credit Behaviour Insight Engine

## Overview
The Rule Engine Module is responsible for evaluating the cleaned and normalized data against a set of predefined rules to identify financial behaviors, assign labels, and generate personalized insights and recommendations.

## Objectives
- Define and store rules for identifying credit behaviors.
- Evaluate input data against these rules.
- Generate appropriate insights and recommendations based on rule matches.

## Steps for Implementation

### 1. Rule Definition and Storage
- **Format Selection**: 
  - Choose a format for storing rules (JSON or YAML).
- **Schema Design**:
  - Define a schema for each rule, including fields for label, compound type, condition, insight template, and recommendation.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a file (e.g., `rules.json` or `rules.yaml`) to store the rules.

### 2. Rule Evaluation
- **Input Processing**: 
  - Receive cleaned and normalized data from the Data Input Module.
- **Condition Evaluation**:
  - Evaluate the conditions defined in the rules against the input data.
  - Use a condition parser to safely evaluate logical expressions.
- **Implementation**:
  - Develop a function to iterate through the rules and evaluate each one.
  - If a rule's condition is met, proceed to generate insights and recommendations.

### 3. Insight and Recommendation Generation
- **Template Rendering**: 
  - Use a template rendering engine to replace placeholders in the insight template with actual values from the input data.
- **Output Generation**:
  - Generate an insight message and a recommendation based on the matched rule.
- **Implementation**:
  - Implement a function to render the insight template and generate the final message.
  - Return the label, insight message, and recommendation.

## Example Code Snippet
```python
import json
from asteval import Interpreter

def load_rules(rules_file):
    with open(rules_file, 'r') as file:
        rules = json.load(file)
    return rules

def evaluate_rule(data, rule, aeval):
    condition = rule['condition']
    try:
        if aeval(condition, locals=data):
            return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error evaluating condition: {e}")
        return False
    return False

def generate_insight(data, rule):
    template = rule['template']
    recommendation = rule['recommendation']
    # Implement template rendering logic here
    insight_message = template.format(**data)
    return rule['label'], insight_message, recommendation

def process_data_with_rules(data, rules):
    aeval = Interpreter()
    for rule in rules:
        if evaluate_rule(data, rule, aeval):
            return generate_insight(data, rule)
    return None, None, None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    rules_file = 'rules/rules.json'
    rules = load_rules(rules_file)
    data = {'creditutilizationratio': 85, 'loantype': 'Credit Card', 'lendertype': 'Bank ABC'}
    label, insight, recommendation = process_data_with_rules(data, rules)
    if label:
        print(f"Label: {label}")
        print(f"Insight: {insight}")
        print(f"Recommendation: {recommendation}")
```

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Write unit tests for each function to ensure they work as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Test the entire rule engine process from data input to insight generation.

## Future Enhancements
- **Rule Prioritization**: 
  - Implement a mechanism to prioritize rules.
- **Complex Rule Conditions**: 
  - Support more complex rule conditions and logical operators.
