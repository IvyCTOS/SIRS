# Implementation Plan for Rule-Based Credit Behaviour Insight Engine

## 1. Project Setup
- **Create Project Repository**: Set up a Git repository for version control.
- **Folder Structure**: Implement the suggested folder structure as outlined in the project requirements.

## 2. Data Input Module
- **PDF Parsing**: 
  - Research and select a suitable library (e.g., `pdfparser`) for extracting data from CTOS credit report PDFs.
  - Implement a preprocessing module to convert PDF data into structured JSON tables.
- **Data Normalization**: 
  - Develop functions to clean and normalize the extracted data into a consistent format.

## 3. Rule Engine Development
- **Define Rules**: 
  - Create a JSON or YAML file to store behavioral labels, compound types, conditions, templates, and recommendations.
- **Logic Implementation**: 
  - Develop the core logic to evaluate conditions and generate insights based on the input data.

## 4. Condition Parser
- **Expression Evaluation**: 
  - Implement a condition parser using libraries like `asteval` or `expr-eval` to safely evaluate logical expressions.
- **Null Handling**: 
  - Ensure the parser can gracefully handle missing or null values.

## 5. Template Renderer
- **Dynamic Template Generation**: 
  - Create a template rendering system using `jinja2` or custom logic to replace placeholders with actual values from the input data.

## 6. Output Aggregator
- **Insight Grouping**: 
  - Develop functionality to group insights by label or section and rank them by severity or frequency.
- **Report Generation**: 
  - Implement export functionality to generate reports in JSON, HTML, or PDF formats.

## 7. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Write unit tests for each module to ensure functionality and reliability.
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Conduct integration tests to verify that all components work together as expected.

## 8. Compliance and Review
- **Compliance Check**: 
  - Review all outputs to ensure they meet compliance requirements (no financial product recommendations, neutral messaging).
- **Feedback Mechanism**: 
  - Implement a feedback logging system to capture user flags or ratings for continuous improvement.

## 9. Future Enhancements
- **Machine Learning Integration**: 
  - Explore the possibility of training ML models using labeled data for predictive insights.
- **User Interface Development**: 
  - Plan for integration with a user interface for real-time recommendations.

## 10. Documentation
- **User Documentation**: 
  - Create comprehensive user documentation detailing how to use the system.
- **Technical Documentation**: 
  - Document the codebase and architecture for future developers.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Project setup and data input module development.
- **Week 3-4**: Rule engine and condition parser implementation.
- **Week 5**: Template renderer and output aggregator development.
- **Week 6**: Testing and compliance review.
- **Week 7**: Future enhancements planning and documentation.
